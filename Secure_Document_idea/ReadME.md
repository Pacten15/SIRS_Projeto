Protection Needs

The protected document must ensure the authenticity of the restaurant data. If a voucher exists, it should be confidential so that only the user should be able to access it.
You can assume that the user and the service share their respective public keys.


Security Challenge

Introduce reviews with classification made by users, e.g. 1 to 5 stars and some text. Reviews should be non-repudiable and other users must be able to verify the authenticity of each review, to ensure credibility and trustworthiness in user feedback.
Regarding the vouchers, each one is tied to a specific user and can only be used once. Moreover, a new mechanism must be implemented to allow users to directly transfer vouchers to other users of the service.
Each user still only has its own keys, so, some dynamic key distribution will have to be devised.

To support these new requirements, the cryptographic library (including the CLI) and the infrastructure should be extended as needed.
