Change interfaces by changing file in path /etc/network/interfaces:

        # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
        # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
        
        source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*
        
        # The loopback network interface and sw-1 interface
        auto lo eth0 eth1                    
        iface lo inet loopback
        
        # sw-1 interface
        iface eth0 inet static          
                address 192.168.2.4
                netmask 255.255.255.0
        		gateway 192.168.2.0
        
        iface eth1 inet dhcp
        	address 10.0.2.2
        	netmask 255.255.255.0

After executing the script turn off the VM and configure the network in the virtual box software and run the VM again so the configuration of the Interfaces is applied.
